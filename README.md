# StarFleetCommand
A fun way of practicing JAVA class hierarchy

Hierarchy:
A fleet comtains a number of star ships.
A ship can be either a battle ship or a cargo ship.
Each ship has its own crew - either human members (AKA colonials) or cylons.
Each ship also has its own weapons and fire power calculaited based on them.
Each ship has its own maintenance costs.

For information on your entire fleet you might find the StarfleetManager file useful.
